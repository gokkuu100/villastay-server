## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

## Usage

To use the API, you will need to send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. The following code snippets show how to do this using the Python requests library:

```python
# Import the requests library
import requests

# Sign up an admin
data = {
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "password"
}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/villas/admin/signup", json=data)
print(response.json())

# Sign up a guest
data = {
    "fname": "John",
    "lname": "Doe",
    "email": "guest@example.com",
    "password": "password"
}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/villas/guest/signup", json=data)
print(response.json())

# Sign in an admin
